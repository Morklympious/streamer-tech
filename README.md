Currently a giant readme of resources for your stream to be cool as hell.

## Vendors
- Streamelements
- Streamlabs

## Music
Music, it's the goddamn lifeblood of your stream sometimes. It's the little fun-maker when you're trying to get your game stood up or yelling at OBS to show the goddamn source you've selected seven hundred years ago. 

These are some options I've seen others use, as well as some options I've used myself.

### Sources
